    "## 1 Linear Algebra\n",
    "It is already interesting that the study of quantum mechanics has two different formulations come up with independently, where one involves Schr√∂dinger equation and the other uses linear algebra. The two formulations are then shown to be equivalent, and we hence have two characterizations of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since linear algebra seems more intuitive and it is a lot easier to work with than partial differential equations, it is then natural that we take the linear algebra as the primary approach to quantum computation formulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having taken MATH 311 (abstract linear algebra) at UVic, I have already gained extensive experience in the concepts of linear transformtaions/operators, eigenvectors/eigenvalues, etc, and so am readily set in position to study quantum computing with the linear algebraic approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dirac Notation\n",
    "Getting used to the Dirac notation at the beginning was a bit challenging, since Dirac notation is not widely used in the mathematical field (as opposed to physics). But after realizing that in Dirac notation, the computational basis vectors (states) for the vector space that an n-qubit state is in are in some correspondence with their binary representation when viewed as n-bit strings, familiarity with the notation was then picked up fast. For example, for a 3-qubit state $|010\\rangle$ in Dirac notation, if viewed as the binary string $010$, which, in decimal represents the number $2$, the vector representation of the state is\n",

    "\n",
    "### Matrix Representation of Quantum Gates\n",
    "One other amazing fact in linear algebra that has helped me in easily producing a matrix representation of a linear operator (in our case, a quantum gate) when given a linear operator (i.e., when given a description of what a quantum gate does). That is, basic linear algebra tells us that a linear operator is completely determined by what it does to an (ordered) basis, (in our case, we just order the computational basis states in the natural order) and that the matrix representation with respect to that basis is then given by the matrix with each column being the image of the corresponding basis vector under the linear map. For example, the (usual) CNOT gate is defined as follows: <br>\n",
    "$\\text{CNOT}|00\\rangle = |00\\rangle$, $\\text{CNOT}|01\\rangle = |01\\rangle$, $\\text{CNOT}|10\\rangle=|11\\rangle$, and $\\text{CNOT}|11\\rangle=|10\\rangle$, and so the matrix representation of the CNOT gate is then given by: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\text{CNOT}|00\\rangle & \\text{CNOT}|01\\rangle & \\text{CNOT}|10\\rangle & \\text{CNOT}|11\\rangle\n",

    "### Bloch Sphere\n",
    "We also note here something very interesting in terms of the geometric representation of a 1-qubit quantum state. Let us consider the following: <br>\n",
    "Given a general 1-qubit quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle$, $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}$ where $\\alpha = a + bi$ and $\\beta = c + di$, $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Thus, in fact, the usual mathematical representation of a 1-qubit state requires four (real) parameters $a, b, c,$ and $d$. But it turns out that we can actually do better than this, and we see this by putting the qubit states into correspondence with the points on the surface of a Bloch sphere (unit sphere centred around the origin). With the help of Euler's formula ($e^{ix} = cos(x) + isin(x$)) and noting that the global phase can be ignored, it can be shown that\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi\\rangle = cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)|0\\rangle + sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)e^{i\\phi}|1\\rangle,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\theta$ represents the angle between the positive $z$-axis and $|\\psi\\rangle$, and $\\phi$ represents the angle between the positive $x$-axis and the projection of $|\\psi\\rangle$ to the $xy$-plane. To this end, we may represent a general 1-qubit state with only two parameters $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ with a clear geormetric representation."

It is proabably readily clear to the reader that Qiskit is a fairly straightforward means to create quantum programs. Whereas Q#, in my honest opinion, as far as user-friendliness, it does not do nearly as good a job as Qiskit. One of the reasons that is is that Q# is based on the programming language C# which I have never gotten my hands on. Moreover, Q# involves more of an abstraction from the quantum circuits that we see as in Qiskit, and is not usually the case that circuits are drawn to be shown in Q# programs (even though this can still be done).\n",

    "## 4 Quantum Algorithms\n",

    "So far, we have seen in lectures (and assignments) the following quantum algorithms:\n",
    "- **Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm**: This algorithm answers the question of whether or not a function $f: \\{0, 1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}$ is constant or balanced (given that we already know it is either constant or balanced).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BB84 (Quantum Key Distribution Protocol)**: This algorithm allows messages to be sent within the honest parties with the presence of an eavesdropping adversary with high proabability that the message being sent is secure from the adversary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grover's Algorithm**: This is a search algorithm with the objective of finding a particular element in an unstructured search space with high probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above three algorithms that I personally prefer the most is the Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm. That is since, first of all, it is the first quantum algorithm that I have ever seen, also, this algorithm gives the correct result with 100% probability, and lastly, this algorithm yields an exponential quantum speed-up with respect to the runtime of a classical solution, which is truly amazing.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note about BB84 is that it only works when encrypting random messages (messages that probably don't have any useful meanings), and so I believe this algorithm isn't particularly practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it is already interesting Grover's algorithm does not require an exhaustive search to find the element of interest in the search space with high probability. It is probably not proper to ask for every algorithm to succeed with 100% probability like Deutsch-Jozsa, but Grover's algorithm allows one to set the error tolerance by performing a sufficient number of 'inversion about the mean', and is therefore widely accepted as an efficient search algorithm."

    "\n",
    "In essence, the Quantum Fourier Transform transforms quantum states in computational basis to their equivalent states in the Fourier basis. But before giving the formula of the QFT, we introduce a useful notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantum States in Computational Basis Written in Decimal Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have an $n$ qubit computational basis state $|\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi_1\\psi_2\\cdots\\psi_n\\rangle$, and in what follows, we may (and do) view (and write) $|\\psi\\rangle$ as \n",

    "$$\n",

In other words, we write a standard quantum state as its decimal representation as a short hand ($|\\phi\\rangle$ is short for $|\\phi_{\\text{binary}}\\rangle$). With this in mind, we are now in position to give the formula of the QFT:\n",

    "We now claim that we may further simplify the above formula and hence uncover how quantum circuits can be built to execute the Quantum Fourier Transform. Although revealing the structure of the Fourier basis takes a bit of work, it is not a bad idea to derive it here, as it would grant us some more clarity on the mathematics used behind it (this also wasn't immediately clear to me during the lecture when this was derived).

    "After completing this course, I am more than motivated to dig deeper into the field of quantum computing. In particular, as a math major, I am extremely interested in mathematical or algebraic structures such as **groups** and **homomorphic copies of graphs**. Some problem that I have thought of, which I think could possibly make use of quantum advantage to solve, include **finding subgroups of a prescribed size of a given group** and **finding the smallest subgraph of a given graph that can arise as a homomorphic copy of such graph**, which are known to be classically hard to solve.\n",
